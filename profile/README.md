# Identicon DAO

As a team we are focused on `identity` and `blockchain enabled attestation protocols`, tools, projects and products. 

This is the home for managing all our projects and repos.

### Project `Socialcap v2: on the Road to Mainnet` (MINA zkIgnite Cohort3)

Communities are the heart and soul of Web3, and credentials are the new foundation for building trust and reputation within them. 
At this current moment in time, very few people in the Open Web communities will argue against this. But  credentials may assume various types and forms. 

In broader terms, as posted in the [Wikipedia credentials definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential): "A credential is a piece of any document that details a qualification, competence, or authority which has been issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials include academic diplomas, academic degrees, certifications, security clearances, identification documents, badges, passwords, user names, keys, powers of attorney, and so on ...". Socialcap aims to cover this broader definition by supporting many of the mentioned use cases. 

#### Why ?

But this also leads to additional questions: Who is the "issuer" of the credential? Can we trust them? Can we prove in some way that the credential has been correctly issued? That it has not been "faked" or "tampered" with? Is it still valid?

In [Socialcap](https://www.socialcap.app), we tackle these issues in an innovative way:

\> We empower communities and their members to issue credentials through a mechanism of 'social consensus', achieved via various forms of 'voting'. 

\> Our approach is fortified by MINA's unique Zero-Knowledge (ZK) privacy and proving capabilities.

`Socialcap` goes beyond traditional credentialing systems, offering community based decentralized voting and issuance, and a privacy-focused solution that aligns with the principles of the Open Web communities. **By combining social consensus and MINA's ZK unique capabilities, we have established a robust and reliable credentialing system for the future of online communities.**

#### Our goal

Become the most flexible and robust tool for all Web communities, showcasing a real-world zkApp empowered by the privacy and proving capabilities of MINA. We also aim for it to be developed "in the open" with active participation from the fantastic MINA community.

To reach this goal, additional effort is needed from both our team and other members of the MINA community. Therefore, this proposal outlines new features and areas of collaboration with other outstanding MINA community members.

### Project `Streamlining Web3 credentials` (MINA zkIgnite Cohort1)

Now called `Socialcap`: https://socialcap.app

A community-based attestation protocol that enables easy self-validation and issuance of credentials using a transparent and repeatable process, while preserving privacy and confidentiality.

By using social proof, validators anonymity, random selection, secret voting, self-auditing, and community rules, our protocol ensures that the validation process is fair, unbiased, and reliable.

Using MINA Zero Knowledge proofs we are building the private and confidential future we all deserve.

It is also designed to be community-driven, allowing each community to set its own claim types, credential prices, validation rules and badges. In this way, the protocol is flexible and can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases.

### Project `Identicon Proof of Life` (NEAR protocol)

A trustless protocol for "Proof of Life" verification in the NEAR network, focused on providing multiple signed verifications of a real world entity and binding it to one (or more) digital identities, and independent of the form these digital identities may take (NFT, DID, etc). 

Is based on a set of decentralized and random selection of human nodes (citizens) which will produce the “on-site” verification of the solicited identity,  proof of life or proof of existence.Typical use cases are "proof of life", "proof of identity" or "proof of anything" for “real people” in the NEAR network. 

**Whitepaper**: The protocol scope, comparison and research of current solutions, as well as additional resources under consideration can be found at our [Preliminar white paper (work in progress)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDRp3crvEXCSTWXkbAY-ONF3Barg7jDoOdzxh1UjYmE/edit?usp=sharing)
