# Identicon DAO

As a team we are focused on identity and blockchain enabled attestation protocols, tools, projects and products. 

This is the home for managing all the DAO projects and repos.

### Project `Streamlining Web3 credentials` (MINA zkIgnite Cohort1)

A community-based attestation protocol that enables easy self-validation and issuance of credentials using a transparent and repeatable process, while preserving privacy and confidentiality.

By using social proof, validators anonymity, random selection, secret voting, self-auditing, and community rules, our protocol ensures that the validation process is fair, unbiased, and reliable.

Using MINA Zero Knowledge proofs we are building the private and confidential future we all deserve.

It is also designed to be community-driven, allowing each community to set its own claim types, credential prices, validation rules and badges. In this way, the protocol is flexible and can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases.

### Project `Identicon on NEAR protocol`

A trustless protocol for "Proof of Life" verification in the NEAR network, focused on providing multiple signed verifications of a real world entity and binding it to one (or more) digital identities, and independent of the form these digital identities may take (NFT, DID, etc). 

Is based on a set of decentralized and random selection of human nodes (citizens) which will produce the “on-site” verification of the solicited identity,  proof of life or proof of existence.Typical use cases are "proof of life", "proof of identity" or "proof of anything" for “real people” in the NEAR network. 

**Whitepaper**: The protocol scope, comparison and research of current solutions, as well as additional resources under consideration can be found at our [Preliminar white paper (work in progress)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDRp3crvEXCSTWXkbAY-ONF3Barg7jDoOdzxh1UjYmE/edit?usp=sharing)
