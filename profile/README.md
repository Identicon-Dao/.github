# Identicon DAO

A DAO for managing the `identicon.network` and it's associated protocols.

We work on blockchain enabled attestation protocols:

### `Identicon.near`

A trustless protocol for "Proof of Life" verification in the NEAR network, focused on providing multiple signed verifications of a real world entity and binding it to one (or more) digital identities, and independent of the form these digital identities may take (NFT, DID, etc). It is not an identity vault or a repo for unique identity. Is based on a set of decentralized and random selection of human nodes (citizens) which will produce the “on-site” verification of the solicited identity,  proof of life or proof of existence.Typical use cases are "proof of life", "proof of identity" or "proof of anything" for “real people” in the NEAR network. 

**Whitepaper**: The protocol scope, comparison and research of current solutions, as well as additional resources under consideration can be found at our [Preliminar white paper (work in progress)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDRp3crvEXCSTWXkbAY-ONF3Barg7jDoOdzxh1UjYmE/edit?usp=sharing)
